1.Define two methods to print the maximum and the minimum number respectively among three numbers entered by the user.
```
    static int largestOfThree(int a,int b,int c){
        if(a>b && a>c){
            return a;
        }else if(b>a && b>c){
            return b;
        }else{
            return c;
        }
    }
```

2.Define a program to find out whether a given number is even or odd.
```
    static String oddEven(int num){
        if(num%2==0){
            return "Even";
        }else{
            return "Odd";
        }
    }
```

3.A person is eligible to vote if his/her age is greater than or equal to 18. Define a method to find out if he/she is eligible to vote.
```
    static String oddEven(int age){
        if(age>=18){
            return "Eligible to vote";
        }else{
            return "Ineligible to vote";
        }
    }
```

4.Write a program to print the sum of two numbers entered by user by defining your own method.
```
    static double add(float num1,float num2){
        double res=num1+num2;
        return res;    
    }
```


5.Define a method that returns the product of two numbers entered by user.
```
    static double add(float num1,float num2){
        double res=num1*num2;
        return res;    
    }
```

6.Write a function that returns all prime numbers between two given numbers.
```

```

7.Write a program that will ask the user to enter his/her marks (out of 100). Define a method that will display grades according to the marks entered as below:
```

```

8.Write a function to find if a number is a palindrome or not. Take number as parameter.
```

```

9.Write a function to check if a given triplet is a Pythagorean triplet or not. (A Pythagorean triplet is when the sum of the square of two numbers is equal to the square of the third number).
```

```

10.Write a function that returns the sum of first n natural numbers.
```

```
