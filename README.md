# My DSA & Interview Prep Journey

Welcome to my personal copy of the DSA Bootcamp repository! I'm using this workspace to track my progress through the
course and to experiment with code snippets while studying for interviews.

- I've subscribed to the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/KunalKushwaha?sub_confirmation=1) and follow along
- My plan is to work through all of the [lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9gnSGHSqcnr_DxHsP7AW9ftq0AtAyYqJ) a
 week, taking notes in the `lectures/` directory
- I visit the [course website](https://www.techwithkunal.com/courses/dsa) for extra resources and problem sets
- Solutions to the [assignments](https://github.com/kunal-kushwaha/DSA-Bootcamp-Java/tree/main/assignments) are referenced
 on LeetCode where I'll tinker with my own versions of the code
